# DiceRollDemoApp
Swift - Dice Roll Demo App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Dice Roll Demo' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a green background with the title on top 'Dice Roll Demo', a large die in the center and a button below 
labeled 'Roll'. The user clicks the 'Roll' button and a random number is generated from 1 to 6. The number is then told
to the person who rolled it on top ex."You rolled a 3" and then the corresponding dice number is shown in the middle.
Each time the person clicks the 'Roll' button another number and die is selected. Sometimes the same one will show up
but that is because of the small set of numbers (1 - 6) to choose from.

Coming soon:
Details and the screen cap images of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/iOSApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
